# hello-world
The time-honored tradition of saying Greetings to the cyber-world.
My name is Michael Chen. I'm a data analyst that seeks the truth in data by extracting the useful and discarding the useless. I believe there's multiple truths to a problem, as well as multiple solutions. The best course of action is decided by the numbers, or the ground truth of the matter.
